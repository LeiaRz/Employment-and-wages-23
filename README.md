# Employment and Wages Data Analysis: Israel 2023 ðŸ“Š

This analysis is my bleak message of fatalism to all my data analyst friends suffering from unearned optimism about securing a new job within a month. Additionally, this report offers a perspective on all spheres of the economy in Israel, including average wages, the number of open positions, and employment statistics.

## Introduction

- **Data Source:** The data was gathered from several job-search platforms and official statistical sources.
- **Focus:** The analysis focuses exclusively on Israel.
- **Time Frame:** The data covers the period before the war that started on October 7, 2023, ensuring it was not affected by any extreme events.
- **Hours:** The 'hours' represent the number of hours between the publication of the job on LinkedIn and the time I scraped the data.

## Analysis Highlights

### Job Applications per Hour
- **Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and Product Managers:** I compared how many people apply to these positions per hour. Interestingly, there are far more Product Managers than I can countâ€”why are there so many?
- **Competition:** The competition is wild for data analysts with an average of 10 people applying for the same position per hour. However, the mean is significantly higher than the median in all three categories, especially for Data Analysts, suggesting a right-skewed distribution.

### Career Opportunities
- **Mid-Senior Level vs. Junior:** There's a higher chance to find an open position for a Mid-Senior level than for a Junior. If you're considering a career change, it might be too late to start at a junior level, but learning Machine Learning (ML) for personal development could still be fulfilling. ðŸ˜Š
