Employment and wages data analysis. Israel 2022-2023

Part 1

Are you constantly applying and want to know what your chances of finding a new job are? I've got you covered. Well, not me exactly, but the numbersâ€”which never lie. I just wrote some scripts, made some calculations, and wrote these words.

This post is my bleak message of fatalism to all my data analyst friends suffering from unearned optimism about securing a new job within a month. Later, Iâ€™ll post the second part of the analysis, which offers a perspective on the nightmare described here. At first glance, it may all seem depressing, but weâ€™re going to make it as fun as it can be, right?

So, here we go:

â€¢	The data was gathered from several job-search platforms and official statistical sources.
â€¢	The analysis focuses exclusively on Israel.
â€¢	The data covers the period before the war that started on October 7, 2023, ensuring it was not affected by any extreme events.
â€¢	The 'hours' represent the number of hours between the publication of the job on LinkedIn and the time I scraped the data.

If you are interested in going through the data or seeing the script, here's the link to my Github for your convenience.

If you have hardly made it to this point of the post, here's the summary of the analysis:

â€¢	I compared how many people apply to Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Product Manager positions per hour. I'm personally interested in DA and DS positions, but I decided to add Product Managers because I know far more Product Managers than I can count. Seriously, why are there so many Product Managers?

â€¢	Numbers show that the competition is wild for data analysts with an average of 10 people applying for the same position per hour. However, the mean is significantly higher than the median in all three categories, especially for Data Analysts where the mean is 10 and the median is 0.5. This suggests a right-skewed distribution, so there are probably several very popular companies with very high numbers of applicants that are pulling the mean up.

â€¢	But if weâ€™re talking about averages, hereâ€™s something for you to understand the scale of this nightmare: For Data Scientist positions, there's less than one applicant per hour, and for Product Managers, it is 2 people per hour, while for Data Analysts, it is 10. Time to learn ML, guys, if you're not there yet.

â€¢	There's a higher chance to find an open position for a Mid-Senior level than for a Junior. One sentence earlier, I told you to start learning ML, but honestly, it might be too late, as your chances to find a junior position are somewhere between 1/8 to 1/34 depending on the position. But you still can learn ML for personal development, isnâ€™t that fulfilling enough? ðŸ˜Š

â€¢	Regarding the sphere, there are a lot of open positions in the technology sphere. The least number of open positions is in e-commerce. Here, I need to remind you that we're still talking about PM, DS, and DA only.
